<!--
     "data-id" could be anything but it'll be used for "switching" (at double click). If it is an entityId than the
     switching will "activate" on this row the entity pointed by entityId - this usually makes no sense so "data-id"
     shouldn't be an entityId but a dummy id in which case switching will be toward "off"
     (aka cancels previously edited entity).

     "data-secondary-row-part" is used to remove this row when the (edited) entity row is closing.
     Its value must be the entityId.

     this.type comes from the server (e.g. FATAL, WARNING)
